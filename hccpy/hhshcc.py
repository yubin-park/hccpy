        ----------
        CCs evolve over years. As patients get older, new CCs are added,

        a higher level (or parent) CCs as the conditinos become more 
        serious. This module provides the difference between "before" and
        "after" and highlights what are "added (both new and upgraded)", 
        "deleted".
